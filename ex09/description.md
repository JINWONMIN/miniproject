**X-Ray**
- X-Ray refers to a radiation (electromagnetic wave) with a strong transmittance that occurs when electrons collide into an object. X-Ray is a kind of radiation that passes easily through low density such as fat, muscle, cloth, and paper, but dense bone and metal materials do not pass well.

- X-Ray photography shows a range of shades(a faint sshaow on the lung area) increasing.
  - The method of distinguishing is simple, but it is often fain when you see the video, so it is difficult to grasp whether it is actually caused by pneumonia of for other reasons.
- Nomal chest X-Ray (left) shows clean lungs with no abnormal shaded area in the image.
- Bacterial pneumonia (middle) is typically represented in the upper right lobe(white arrow), while Viral pneumonia (right) is represented by a more spread "interstitial(between cells)" pattern than in both lungs.
